					<h4>Step 1 - Become a Member</h4>
					<p class="mb-0">Join KeysArise to access home-buying support. Contribute to the funding pool that helps members buy homes.</p>
					<strong>How It Works</strong>
					<ul>
					    <li>Meet eligibility criteria (18+, proof of income, stable finances).</li>
					    <li>Register online & submit required documents.</li>
					    <li>Membership approval takes 3-5 working days, provided all required information is submitted.</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Step 2 - Find a Home</h4>
					<strong>What This Means</strong>
					<p class="mb-0">Choose a home that fits your needs and meets KeysArise’s approval criteria. Work with KeysArise advisors to evaluate and approve your choice.</p>
					<strong>How It Works</strong>
					<ul>
					    <li>Select from new-builds, existing homes, or approved properties.</li>
					    <li>Submit details for pre-approval. The approval timeline varies by property and typically ranges from 4 to 12 weeks.</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Step 3 - Secure Funding & Support Others</h4>
					<strong>What This Means</strong>
					<p class="mb-0">Receive financial assistance based on your contribution and eligibility. Your contributions also help fund other members' home purchases.</p>
					<strong>How It Works</strong>
					<ul>
					    <li>Funding models include partial support, structured repayments, or collaborative funding.</li>
					    <li>Approval process takes 2-4 weeks depending on financial review.</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Step 4 - Buy & Move In</h4>
					<strong>What This Means</strong>
					<p class="mb-0">Finalize the purchase and become a homeowner. KeysArise handles the legal and financial processes to ensure a smooth transaction.</p>
					<strong>How It Works</strong>
					<ul>
					    <li>Sign final agreements & complete financial obligations.</li>
					    <li>Ownership transfer & legal paperwork (4-6 weeks).</li>
					</ul>
					<strong>Security & Financial Safeguards</strong>
					<ul>
					    <li>Your Investment is Secure - Funds are legally protected, and purchases follow strict financial guidelines.</li>
					    <li>Exit Options Available - Members can withdraw from funding under pre-defined conditions.</li>
					    <li>Audited & Regulated Transactions - Future FCA compliance ensures financial integrity.</li>
					</ul>
